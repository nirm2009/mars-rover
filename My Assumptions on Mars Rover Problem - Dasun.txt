Dependencies
gradle version : 5.1
log4j version : 1.2.17

Assumptions
Solution was created with Reusability in mind and various usages of best practices.

Square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).
Square directly South from (x, y) is (x, y-1).
Square directly East from (x, y) is (x+1, y).
Square directly West from (x, y) is (x-1, y).

Lower-left coordinates are always 0, 0.

Console input of value 'Q' would terminate the program.

In the code, 'plateau upper right coordinates' will be refered to as 'plateau size'.

No threading is used since all rovers move synchronously.

Inability for a rover to move to a given new position (because of new position already being occupied)  
is considered an error and an exception will be thrown.
